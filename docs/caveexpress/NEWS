The new version of CaveExpress is now available. It includes some bugfixes and a lot of new features.

Let's talk about the bugs first:
A very annoying bug was fixed that could lead to a sliding mastodon while it was dazed by a stone.
In addition to the linux versions are no longer linked against the most recent glibc version - you should now be able to run the game on most of the older distributions, too.
Another SDL2 related bug was fixed that could cause some OpenGL drivers to go nuts (on Android GLES2 devices it for example caused a red screen rendering).

The biggest changes (besides the bug fixes) are that the multiplayer menu and lobby was improved a lot.
For the multiplayer part I also added a crashed player animation that is of course also part of the singleplayer mode.
Most noticeable to player is maybe the water physic change. The items are no longer jumping out of the water and the diving into the water is more realistic now.
A very minor thing but worth a few words is maybe that the 'continue campaign' button is no longer in the main menu - it's now in the campaign overview menu.
Last but not least I've put some work into the UI joystick support. You can now use the analog stick to scroll through the menus.

I hope you enjoy playing the new release as I did creating it.

The next release will again contain a new campaign with fresh maps. The usual bugfixes as well as an improved map editor.
